# Handoff log

Newest entry first. Rules and format are in `AGENTS.md`.

## 2026-10-22: Claude, claude/agent-handoff

Did: added `AGENTS.md` (shared rules and lanes), `CLAUDE.md` (pointer to `AGENTS.md`) and this file.
Next: Codex, pull `main` once this is merged and read `AGENTS.md`.
Watch out: nothing in this PR touches site code or data.

## 2026-10-22: Claude, brand/shopping-bag (PR #6)

Did: added shopping bag artwork in `brand/packaging/` (front and back panels at 340 × 300 mm, mockup, printer spec), `brand/BRAND-SHEET.md`, and `tools/packaging/build_bag.py`.
Next: the owner sends the WhatsApp business number so the QR placeholder can be replaced, then gets printer quotes.
Watch out: the bag uses the existing outlined wordmark from `brand/northline-wordmark-cream.svg`. No site files were changed.

## 2026-10-22: Codex, codex/shop-card-polish

Did: polished the shop product cards (`shop/index.html`, `tools/ui-flow-patch.py`). The branch also carries robot data updates.
Next: Codex to add its own entry when it finishes.
Watch out: this entry was written by Claude from the branch's commits, so Codex should correct it if anything is wrong.
